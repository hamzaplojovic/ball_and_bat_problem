# Ball and Bat Cost Problem

This repository contains a Python script (`main.py`) that solves a simple problem: If a bat costs $1 more than a ball, and you have both a ball and a bat, how much does each one cost?

## Problem Statement

Given that:

-   You have a ball and a bat.
-   The bat costs $1 more than the ball.

The script calculates the cost of each item.

## Solution

The script uses a simple mathematical approach to solve the problem. It assumes that the total cost of both the ball and the bat is known.

Here's a brief overview of how the script works:

1. It first subtracts $1 from the total cost to account for the extra dollar that the bat costs.
2. The result is then divided by 2 to find the cost of the ball.
3. Finally, it adds $1 to the cost of the ball to find the cost of the bat.

## Usage

To run the script, use the following command:

python main.py

You will be prompted to enter the total cost of the ball and the bat. After entering the total cost, the script will display the cost of each item.

**Please replace the usage and solution sections with the actual details from your main.py file if they differ.**
